# BlackJack

This is a BlackJack simulator to be run from any browser using bj.js.  It has as Spring/Rest (Jax-RS) API back-end with some google GSON sprinkled throughout for serialization help.  It is a bit old school but was my first attempt at some gaming fun.

To Run
-------
1)  Run this project (I used Intellij)
2)  Run bj.js and try to beat the computer.

Enjoy!
